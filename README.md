# To-do List App
This is a simple to-do list application made using ReactJS and create-react-app.

### Features
The features are pretty basic, they are as follows:
 - Add New Tasks
 - List the Tasks

### How to Run It
  1. Make sure npm is installed. You can install npm by installing Node.js. Node.js is an environment for developing server-side applications. When you install Node.js, npm will install automatically.
  2. Run these lines of code:
  ```
  npm install
  npm start
  ```
This should direct you to a local server (the default is 3000).
